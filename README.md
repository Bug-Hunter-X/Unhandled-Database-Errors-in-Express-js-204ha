# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the failure to handle database errors and invalid input gracefully.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of this error; the `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution.

## The Problem

Express.js doesn't inherently handle errors thrown by database interactions. If a database query fails (e.g., due to a network problem or an invalid ID), the application will crash without proper error handling.  This leads to unreliable services and poor user experience.

## The Solution

Proper error handling is crucial. Always anticipate potential issues in database calls and other external services.  Use `try...catch` blocks or callbacks with error handling to trap errors and return meaningful responses to the client.
